# Oil and Water data analysis for Undark

The following workshop walks you through a data analysis and visualization I carried out for [Undark magazine](https://undark.org/article/oil-pipeline-safety-dakota-access-standing-rock/) on the risk of an oil spill surrounding the Dakota Access Pipeline debate. It is an introduction to finding, cleaning and visualizing federal data using Excel and Carto.com. 

## The Dakota Access Pipeline protest of 2016

### Questions I had that guided my reporting

### What are these protestors angry about?

### Could DAPL rupture? If so, what was the risk?

### How often do spills occur?

### When they rupture, how much oil spills?

### And where in the U.S. do these spills occur?

## How I put it together

I found [data](https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/pipeline/library/data-stats/flagged-data-files) from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA).

I downloaded a zip file.

The government was nice enough to tell me what every column corresponded to.

## Do the analysis yourself

For this workshop, download a filtered version I cleaned up that only has crude oil spills over 100 barrels (net lost) since 2010 [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B56vzj8m6JInRWZGM0tyQk94VTA/view?usp=sharing). If you want the full zip file of PHMSA flagged incidents go [here](https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/pipeline/library/data-stats/flagged-data-files).

## Build the map yourself

Boot up [Carto.com](http://Carto.com), create a login and upload the CSV from above. Plot the data by latitude and longitude and then style the points by net barrels recovered. Voil√°.

You might also want to add in shapefiles for the country's crude oil pipelines. Those can be found in a [zip](https://www.eia.gov/maps/map_data/BorderCrossing_Liquids_EIA.zip) from the [U.S. Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/maps/layer_info-m.php). Extra points if you can track down and plot the shapefile for the Standing Rock reservation.
